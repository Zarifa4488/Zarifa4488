## 🌟 About Me

I’m a self-driven developer, building real products while raising my son and rewriting my story.

After completing my master’s degree in Japan, I worked for three years at a global Japanese company as an accounting staff member. During that time, I participated in several internal software development projects — and that’s when everything clicked.

Working closely with engineers while handling bookkeeping and operations, I realized I had ideas — and the drive to bring them to life. That experience fired up my passion for tech, and I’ve been building ever since.

Now, I’m developing **BookEasy.online** — a web application built with Node.js and MongoDB, designed to assist foreign travelers in Japan with multilingual restaurant and car reservations. The platform features responsive design, dynamic filtering, and admin tools for concierge teams and restaurant managers.

My goal? To combine functionality, simplicity, and storytelling in everything I code — giving soul to the projects I once dreamed of.
